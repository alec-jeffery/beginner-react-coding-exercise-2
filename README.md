# Welcome 😃

Here's a little project to test your React skills by building a simple quote viewer.

A mock api has been included and is where you will get your quotes from. You can view what's
stored by opening the `db.json` file at the root of the project folder.

&nbsp;

## Goals / Outcomes ✨

- Complete the UI based on the design (See Adobe XD link below)
- Fetch data from the mock API
- Be able to navigate forward and backward through available quotes in a never ending loop

&nbsp;

## Prerequisites ✅

You'll want to have an understanding of React functional components, hooks and the fetch API

&nbsp;

## How do I get started?

The scaffolding app is done with _create-react-app_ as the foundation.

- Clone this repository
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Open a second terminal shell
- Run `npm start` to start the application on port http://localhost:3000 (CRA default) in one shell
- Run `npm run server` to start the mock api on http://localhost:5000/data in the second shell

&nbsp;

## What's Already Been Done 🏁

- Some markup and css styling

&nbsp;

## Bonus points

- Utilize TailwindCSS as much as possible
- Animate it!
- Add page indicators

&nbsp;
